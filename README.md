# Lumby Vibes

A medieval-themed game development project built with Pygame. This repository is inspired by RuneScape's Lumbridge area and aims to create interactive simulations and games with a nostalgic touch.

## Current Features

- **`lumbridge.py`**: A simulation of Lumbridge with detailed buildings like castles, churches, and farms.
- **`medieval_game.py`**: A basic RPG game featuring player stats, skills (mining, fishing, woodcutting), and inventory management.
- **`medieval_village.py`**: A village simulation showcasing various building types and their visual representations.

## What's Next

- Expanding the RPG mechanics with quests and NPC interactions.
- Adding multiplayer capabilities for collaborative gameplay.
- Enhancing graphics and animations for a more immersive experience.
- Introducing a dynamic economy system with trade and resource management.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library
